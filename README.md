# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

I was tasked to help Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for the ***PyCity School District***, in an analysis of overall district performance, individual school performance, Top and Bottom performing schools, Average Math and Reading scores for each grade from each school, Scores by school spending, Scores by school size and Scores by school type. This analysis will help the School board make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities based on the standardized test scores and current school funding

To complete the task, I had to use Anaconda and the Jupyter Notebook.

## Purpose

For this part of the Challenge, write a report that summarizes your updated analysis and compares it with the results from the module.

The analysis should contain the following:
