# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

I was tasked to help Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for the ***PyCity School District***, in an analysis of overall district performance, individual school performance, Top and Bottom performing schools, Average Math and Reading scores for each grade from each school, Scores by school spending, Scores by school size and Scores by school type. This analysis will help the School board make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities based on the standardized test scores and current school funding

To complete the task, I had to use Anaconda and the Jupyter Notebook.

## Purpose of this Analysis

I completd my analysis as requested, but then the school board notified Maria and her supervisor that the `students_complete.csv` file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for **Thomas High School** ninth graders appear to have been altered. 

Although the school board did not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they wanted to uphold state-testing standards and turned to Maria for help. Maria asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 

Once I replace the math and reading scores, Maria would like me to repeat the school district analysis that I did earlier and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Analysis Steps

In the initial analyis (see the code file `PyCitySchools.ipynb`), we created a script to perform the required analysis.

For this analysis, we had to only change the **9th** grade **Math** and **Reading** scores for the school **Thoams High School**, and run the script that I created for the initial analysis.

Below are the steps that were undertaken

1. Installed `numpy` using the command `conda install numpy`

2. Imported numpy 
`import numpy as np`

3. Used the `loc` method on the **student_data_df** to select **all** the reading scores from the **9th** grade at **Thomas High School** and replaced them with NaN.
```
student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df["school_name"] == "Thomas High School") & (student_data_df["grade"] == "9th") & (student_data_df["reading_score"] > 0), "reading_score"] = np.nan
```
4. Refactored the code in previous step to replace the **math** scores with NaN.

```
student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df["school_name"] == "Thomas High School") & (student_data_df["grade"] == "9th") & (student_data_df["math_score"] > 0), "math_score"] = np.nan
```
5. Checked the student data for NaN's using the code `student_data_df.tail(10)`

6. Repeated the **school district analysis** that was done in Module 4 to recreate the metrices

## Analysis Results

Below are the answers to questions realated to how the replacement affected various metrices.

#### 1. How is the ***district*** summary affected?

*There  is a slight downward change in district averages*
* Average Math Score:       Decreased by 0.1 (from 79.0 to 78.9)
* Average Reading Score:    No change (from 81.9)
* Passing Math %:           Decreased by 1% (from 75 to 74)
* Passing Reading %:        Decreased by 1% (from 86 to 85)
* Overall Passing %:        Decreased by 1% (from 65 to 64)

#### 2. How is the ***school*** summary affected?

*The induvidual scores of schools except ***Thomas High School*** haven't changed*

*Drastic decrease in the Passing Math %, Passing Reading % and Overall Passing % of ***Thomas High School***.*
* Passing Math % decreased from 93.27% to 66.91%
* Passing Reading % decreased from 97.31% to 69.66%
* Overall Passing % decreased from 90.95% to 65.08%

#### 3. How does the replacement affect ***Thomas High Schoolâ€™s*** performance relative to the other schools?
Before the replacement, ***Thomas High School*** was placed 2nd amongst the 15 school according to **Overall Passing %**. With the changes, it lost 6 places and moved to the 8th spot.

The schools that were earlier placed between 3rd and 8th, all gained one spot.

#### 4. How does the replacement affect the Math and Reading scores by ***grade***
*As the changes were made only to the scores of the 9th grade of **Thomas High School**, only 2 entries were affected, all others remained the same*
* The 9th grade maths scores of **Thomas High School** were changed from 83.6 to nan
* The 9th grade reading scores of **Thomas High School**were changed from 83.7 to nan

#### 5. How does the replacement affect the scores by ***school spending***
*As **Thomas High School** fell in the $630-$644 range, changes were seen in this range, the other 3 ranges were unaffected*
* The  Passing Math % for the **$630-$644 range** dropped from 73% to 67%
* The Passing Reading % for the **$630-$644 range** dropped from 84 to 77%
* The Overall Passing % for the **$630-$644 range** dropped from 63% to 56%

#### 6.  How does the replacement affect the scores by ***school size***
*As **Thomas High School** fell in the Medium-Size-School category, changes were seen in this range, the other 2 categories were unaffected*
* The  Passing Math % for the **Medium-Size-School category** dropped from 94% to 88%
* The Passing Reading % for the **Medium-Size-School category** dropped from 97 to 91%
* The Overall Passing % for the **Medium-Size-School category** dropped from 91% to 85%

#### 7.  How does the replacement affect the scores by ***school type***
*As **Thomas High School** fell in the Charter School type, changes were seen in this School type, the other type was unaffected*
* The Passing Math % for **Charter Schools** dropped from 94% to 90%
* The Passing Reading % for **Charter Schools** dropped from 97 to 93%
* The Overall Passing % for **Charter Schools** dropped from 90% to 87%

## Summary

Although, as demonstrated above, there have been many minor changes to the school disctrict analysis after the score replacement, according to me the 4-5 major changes are:
1. The drop in Passing Math, Passing Reading and Overall Passing % of the overall district by 1%. This can look like a small drop, but when the performance of the district is compared against other districts in the state or in the country, it can be quite big a drop. It could lead to the disctrict losing tens of places in such comparisions.  
2. The drastic decrease in the Passing Math %, Passing Reading % and Overall Passing % of **Thomas High School**: from 93% to 67%, 97% to 70% and 91% to 65% respectively. This affected all metrices this school is a part of.
3. Relatd to the earlier point, but yet a major change in itself is the change in the ranking of **Thomas High School** in relation to other schools. Before the change, sitting at #2, it was amongst the best schools; now at #8, it is an average performing school with evidence of academic dishonesty. This can have many implications on how the school is treated in the future.
4. Before the changes, the top performing School-size was **Medium (1000-2000)**, with  overall passing % of 91. After the replacements, this school category has moved to the 2nd spot, with the 1st spot now taken by the **Small (<1000)** school size. The results now show a co-realtion between school size and performace - we can infer, the smaller the school size, the better the performance. 
5. Before the changes, there was a significant  gap of **9%** between the overall passing % of schools with budget $630-$644 and $645-$675. After the replacements, this gap has narrowed down to only **2%**.
