# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

I was tasked to help Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for the ***PyCity School District***, in an analysis of overall district performance, individual school performance, Top and Bottom performing schools, Average Math and Reading scores for each grade from each school, Scores by school spending, Scores by school size and Scores by school type. This analysis will help the School board make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities based on the standardized test scores and current school funding

To complete the task, I had to use Anaconda and the Jupyter Notebook.

## Purpose

I completd my analysis as requested, but then the school board notified Maria and her supervisor that the `students_complete.csv` file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for **Thomas High School** ninth graders appear to have been altered. 

Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. Maria asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. 

Once I have replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like me to repeat the school district analysis that I did and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Analysis Steps

In the initial analyis (see the code file `PyCitySchools.ipynb`), we created a script to perfomr the required analysis.

For this analysis, we have to only change the **9th** grade **Math** and **Reading** scores for the school **Thoams High School**, and run the script that I created for the initial analysis.

Below are the steps that were undertaken

1. Installed numpy using the command `conda install numpy`

2. Imported numpy 
`import numpy as np`

3. Used the loc method on the student_data_df to select **all** the reading scores from the **9th** grade at **Thomas High School** and replaced them with NaN.
```
student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df["school_name"] == "Thomas High School") & (student_data_df["grade"] == "9th") & (student_data_df["reading_score"] > 0), "reading_score"] = np.nan
```
4. Refactored the code in previous step to replace the **math** scores with NaN.

```
student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df["school_name"] == "Thomas High School") & (student_data_df["grade"] == "9th") & (student_data_df["math_score"] > 0), "math_score"] = np.nan
```

=========================

For this part of the Challenge, write a report that summarizes your updated analysis and compares it with the results from the module.

The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type

Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
